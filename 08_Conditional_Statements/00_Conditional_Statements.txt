Conditional  Statements
-------------------------------------
1)  if  statement
2)  switch  statement

if  statement
----------------------
1) if  with  else
2) if  without  else

if  with  else
---------------------
1)  if(condition)
     {
      	 stmt1;
      	 stmt2;
      	 stmt3;
     }
    else
     {
      	 stmt4;
       	 stmt5;
       	 stmt6;
     }
     stmt7;

2) Statements  1,  2  ,  3  are  executed  when  condition    is  true

3) Statements  4,  5  ,  6    are    executed  when  condition   is  false

4) Statement  7  is  always  executed  irrespective  of  the  condition becoz   stmt7  is  outside  of  if

5) else  part  is  executed  only  when  condition   is  false
    In  otherwords  else  part  is  skipped  when  condition   is  true

6) for  every  else,  corresponding  'if'    is  mandatory
    i.e. There  can  not  be   else  without  if

7)  There  can  be  if  without  else  but  not  vice-versa

8)  if  and  else  are  keywords  and  hence  they  must  be  written  in  lower   case

9)  condition   must  be  enclosed  in  ()

10)  Braces    are   mandatory   when  there  is  more  than  one  statement

11)  Braces  are  optional  for  single  statement

12) There  is  no  ;  at  the  end  of  the  condition  becoz   ;  is  statement  terminator  but  not  condition     terminator

13)  else  leads  to   error  when  there is  ;   at the end of  the condition


if  without  else
---------------------------
1)     if  (cond)
	{
		stmt1;
		stmt2;
		stmt3;
	}
	stmt4;

2) Statements  1, 2 , 3  are  executed  when  condition  is  true

3) Nothing  is  executed  when  condition  is  false  becoz   else  part  is  missing

4)  stmt4  is  always  executed  irrespective  of  the  condition   becoz   stmt4  is  outside   of  if


Note:
1)  ?  :  is  conditional  operator

2)  if  is  conditional  statement
