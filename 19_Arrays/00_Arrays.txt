Array
---------
1)  Array  of  numbers
2)  Array  of  characters(i.e.  string)
3)  Array  of  pointers
4)  Array  of  strings
5)  Array  of  structutes
6)  Array  of  arrays  (i.e.  2-dimensional  array)


Definition   of  array
---------------------------------

1) Array  is  a  homogenous  collection  of  elements  represented  in  contiguous  memory  locations

2) []  is  array  operator

3) Array  can  not  contain  different  types  of  elements
     i.e.  25 , 10.8 , 'g' , "Hyd" and so on

4) All  the  elements  of  array  must  be  of  same  type

Note:
1)  int   a = 25;  ---->  Variabe   can  hold  single  value,
     int  b[] = {10 , 20 , 30 , 40}; ----> Array  can  hold  multiple  values
     In  otherwords,  variable  is  used   to  represent  single  value  and  array  is  used  to  represent  multiple
     values

2)  int  x;
     int  *p;
     int  a[5];
     []   is  used  to  declare  array,  *  is  used  to  declare  pointer  and   no  operator  is  required to  declare
     variable.
     'x'  is  variable ,  'p'   is  pointer  and  'a'  is  an  array
