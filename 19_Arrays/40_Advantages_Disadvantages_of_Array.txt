Advantages  of  Array
-------------------------------------
1) Random  Access  but  not  sequential
    Eg:  10th  element  of  array  can  be  accessed  directly  by  a[9]  without  accessing  first  9  elements.
            This  is  possible  due  to  subscripts

2) All  elements  are  under  single  name(like  super  market)
    Eg:  int  a[10];    -->  All  10  elements  are  under  single  name    'a'

3) To  represent   marks  of  10   subjects ,  10   variables   are    not  required  instead  a  single  array  is  enough  with
     size  10
     Eg :  int  marks[10];

4) Arrays  are  used  to  implement  Stack , Queue , Tree , Graph , Matrix   and  so  on

5) Similar  type  of  elements  i.e.  Array  can  not  hold  different  types  of  elements

6) If  we  know  address  of  first  element,  remaining  elements  of   array   can  be  accessed  easily  becoz  they  are
    represented  in  contiguous  memory  locations

Disadvantages
--------------------------
1) Insertion  and  deletion  are  difficult  becoz  shifting  is  involved
    Eg:    10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60
    To  insert  25  between  20  and  30,   remaining  elements  60 , 50 , 40   and   30  must  be  shifted    to  successor
    locations  and  then  insert  25  between  20  and  30

    Eg:  10 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60
    To  delete  25,  remaining  elements  30 , 40 , 50   and  60  are  shifted   to  predecessor  locations

2) Array  size  must  be  known  in  advance
    i.e.  Array  can  not  be  created  without  specifying  the  size

3) Array  size  can  not  be  increased   and   decreased
     i.e.  array  size  is  fixed
     In  otherwords,  array  is  neither  growable  nor  shrinkable

4) Memory   wastage  and overflow
     Eg:  If  Array  size  is  20  and   we  are  representing  only  7  elements  in  the  array,  remaining  13  locations  are  wasted.
     Eg:  If  Array  size  is  20   and   we  try  to  represent  21  elements,  it  leads  to  overflow

5) There  is  no  subscript  verification  in  'C'   language
     Eg:  int  a[]  =  {10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50};
            printf("%d" , a[5]);  --->   Garbage  value  but  not  error  even  though  5  is  invalid  subscript

Applications  of  Array
--------------------------------------
1) Array  is   used   to   represent  similar  type  of  elements

2) Large  amount  of  data  can  be  represented  in  a  single  name and it  avoids  usage  of  multiple  variables

3) Arrays  are  used  for  sorting  elements

4) Arrays  are  used  for  matrix  operations

5) Array  can  be  used  to  represent  records(student  records , employee records  , customer  records)

6) Array  can  be  used  to  implement  stack , Queue , Tree , Graph , Hash  table  and  so   on
