switch  statement
-------------------------------
1) When  there  are    too  many  if  statements ,  switch  statement  is  used   as  an  alternative

2) switch  provides  more  clarity  and  better  readability

3) if   statement  is  used  when  conditions  are  involved    and
    switch  statement  is  used   when  selection  is  involved

4) Every  switch  can  be  replaced  with  if-else  but  vice-versa  may  not  be  possible  always

Rules:
-----------
1) switch  takes  Variable  or  Expression
     Eg 1  :  switch(Variable)
     Eg 2  :  switch(Expression)

2) switch  variable  can  be  int  or  char  but  not  float
    Eg  :    float  a;
               switch(a)  --->   Error  becoz  variable  'a'  is  float
               {
	       }

3) case  label  can  be  integer  or  character
     Eg 1   :   case    7 :  --->  ok
     Eg 2   :   case   'g' : ----> ok
     Eg 3  :    case    10.8 :  --->  Error  becoz  float  is  not  allowed
     Eg 4  :    case    "Hyd":  ---> Error  becoz   string  is  not  allowed

4) case  label   can  not  be  duplicated
    Invalid :    case    7 :
                     case    7 :

5) There  must  be  at  least  one  space  between  case  and  label  otherwise  default  is  executed

break  statement
-----------------------------
1)  When  break  statement  is  executed,  remaining  cases  are  skipped  and  control  goes  out  of  switch

2)  Next  statement  executed  after  break  is  statement outside  switch

3)  If  break  statement  is  omitted,  statements  of  next  case  are  also  executed  which  is  not  desirable

4)  Thus  execution  becomes  sequential  until  break  is  found

5)  break  is  used  to  suspend  sequential  execution

6)  Every  break  is  mandatory   but   last  break  is  optional

7)  switch  braces  are  mandatory  but  case  braces  are  optional


default
------------
1)  It  is  executed  when  none  of  the  cases  are  executed

2)  It  can  be  used  anywhere  inside  switch   i.e. At  begining, middle  or  end  of  switch

3)  There  can  be  switch  without  default  i.e.  default  is  optional

Note  :  switch , case , break  and  default  are  keywords
