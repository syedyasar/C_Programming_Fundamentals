fgets()
-----------
1) gets()  reads  string  from  keyboard  and
    fgets()  reads  string  from  file

2) They  are  defined  in  <stdio.h>

3) Open  the  file  in  any  mode  except  "w"  and  "a"  modes  in  order  to  use  fgets()

4) fgets()  has  3  parameters
    a) Array  i.e. character  array
    b) How  many  characters  to  be  read  from  the  file
    c) fp  (file  pointer)

5) char  a[4];
     fgets(a , 3 , fp);  --->  reads  3  characters  of  the  file   from  the  current  position   of   fp
     If  fp  points  to  string  "RAJESH"  in  the  file,  first  3  characters  of  "RAJESH"  are  read  to  array  'a'.
     i.e.  Array  contains  "RAJ"  and  fp  is  advanced  to  4th  character  i.e.  'E'

6) char  a[11];
    fgets(a , 10 , fp);  --->  reads  10  characters  of  the  file  from  the  current  position  of  fp
    If  fp  points  to  string  "RAJESH"  in  the  file,  characters  till  end  of  the  line  are  read  to  array  a.
    i.e.  Array  contains  "RAJESH\n"  and  fp  is  advanced  to  begining  of  next  line


feof()
---------
1) feof(fp);

2) It  is  used  to  determine  end  of  the  file  is  reached  or  not

3) It  returns  true  when  fp  points  to  end  of  the  file

4) It  returns  false  when  fp  points  to  begining  or  middle  of  the  file

5) It  is  defined  in  <stdio.h>  file
