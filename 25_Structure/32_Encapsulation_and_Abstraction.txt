Encapsulation
------------------------
1)  struct  emp
     {
	   int  empno;
	   char  ename[20];
	   float  sal;
      };

2) Integration  of  related  data  is  known  as  encapsulation
    Eg:  Employee  related  data  such  as  empno , emp  name  and  salary  are  integrated  to  form  a
           single  unit  i.e.  structure

3) Encapsulation  is  possible  by  using  structure

4) Representation  of  data  in  the  form  of  variables  is  not  encapsulation

5) Use  different  structures  to  represent  employee , student , customer , triangle , rectangle  and  so  on

6)	struct      bad
	{
		int  rollno;
		char  studname[20];
		int  empno;
		char  empname[20];
	};

7) Representing  emp  data  and  stud  data  in  the  same  structure  is  a  bad  encapsulation.

8)  Integrate  data  but  related  data.
     student   data  and  employee  data  are  no  way  related.

9)  Use  2  different  structures  to  represent  student  and  employee

Note:
1)  laptop  computer  supports  encapsulation  but  not  desktop  computer

2)  IC  chip  supports  encapsulation


Abstraction  and  ADT(Abstract  Data  Type)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)	struct  emp
	{
		int  empno;
		char  ename[20];
		float  sal;
	};

2)  Hiding  internal  details  of  the  structure  from  end  user  is  known  as  abstraction.

3)  Internal  details  like  names  of  the  members,  their  datatypes,  number  of  members  and  so  on   are
     hidden

4)  Client  can  use  structure  but  internal  details  of  the  structure  are  hidden   from  the  client

5)  int + char[] + float = struct  emp
     i.e.    3  datatypes  are  combined  to  form  a  new  data  type   struct  emp

6)  struct  emp  is  called  ADT

Note:
1) int , float , char  are  PDT's(Primitive  Data  Types)

2) com , date , stud  are  ADT's  (Abstract  Data  Types)
