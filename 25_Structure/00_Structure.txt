Structure
----------------
1)  It  is  a  collection  of  members  which  are  of  different  types

2)  It  can  hold  different  types  of  values  which  is  not  possible  with   array

3)  Array  and  structure  are    quite  opposite
     i.e.  Array  is  a    homogeneous  collection  but  structure  is  hetrogeneous  collection

4)  There  are  2  parts
     a)  Structure  definition
     b)  Structure  declaration

5) Structure  can  not  be  declared  without  definition
     i.e.  define   first  and  then  declare

Structure  definition
-----------------------------------
struct  Emp  --->  Structure  Definition
{
	int        empno;
	char    ename[20];
	float      sal;
	char      gender;
};

1) This  is  called  structure  definition

2) It  informs  system  about  members  of  the  structure

3) empno , ename , sal  and  gender  are  members  of  the  structure but    not  variables

4) No  memory  is  allocated  to  members  when  structure  is  defined

5) 0  bytes  of  memory  is  allocated  when  structure  is  defined

6) struct  is  a  keyword  and  Emp  is  user  defined  word

7) Emp  is  structure  tag  and  structure  is  identified  by  tag

8) No  2  structures  can  have  same  tag
    i.e.  structures  are  distinguished  by  tags


Structure  declaration
-------------------------------------
1) struct   Emp    a;  --->    This  is  structure  declaration

2)  'a'  is  structure  of  type  Emp

3) Memory  is  allocated  to  members  only  when  structure  is  declared  but  not  when  it  is  defined

4)  Size  of  a  structure  is  sum  of  sizes  of  members
     i.e.  sizeof(struct  Emp)  is  4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 29B

5) Structure  'a'  is  created  and  29B  of  memory  is  allocated
    i.e. First  4B  for  empno , Next 20B  is  for  ename , Next  4B  is  for  sal  and  next  1B  is  for  gender

6) structure  'a'  initially  contains  garbage  values

7) a . empno , a . ename , a . sal  and  a . gender  are  members  of  the  structure

8)  '.'  is  member  access  operator
     i.e.  '.'  operator   is   used   to  access  members  of  the  structure
     Syntax  --->    structure.member

Note:
1)  []  operator  is  required  to  access  array

2)  '.'  operator  is  required  to  access  structure

3) []  is  called  subscript  operator  and  '.'  is  called  member  access  operator

4) There   is  no  keyword  to  declare  variable , pointer and  array  but  there   is  struct  keyword  to   define
    and  declare  structure
