main  function
--------------------------
1)   main()
      {
		stmt1;
		stmt2;
		stmt3;
		....
      }

2) Every  'C'  program  must  contain  main  function

3) It  is  not  possible  to  compile  and  run  a  program  without  main  function

4)  main  is  mandatory  in  every  'C'  program

5)  main  is  a  special  name  and   It  is  not   a    user  defined  word  nor  key  word
     Eg:   auto  -->  Keyword
             sum  -->  User  defined  word
             main  -->  Special  name

6)  It  is  operating  system(OS)  which  calls    main  function  as  soon  as  program  is  executed
     i.e.  define  main   function ,  leave  it   and   OS  executes  main  function

7)  int  main(), void  main()  and  main()  are  same

8)  Main()    ---->  Error  becoz  main  must  be  in  lower  case
     {
     }

9) main  is  a  user  defined  function   but  not  predefined   function
    There is no  header  file  for main function
	
	
	File  Inclusion
------------------------
1)  #include  <stdio.h>
     #include  <conio.h>
     main()
     {
	   statements
     }

2) When  scanf  and  printf  functions   are  used,  include  <stdio.h>  file.

3) Similarly,  when  sqrt  and  pow  are  used,  include  <math.h>  file

4) In  general,  function  can  not  be  used  without  including  corresponding    file
    i.e.  Include  the  file  and  then  use  functions  of  the  file

5) #include  is  usually   written   at  the  begining  of  the  program

6) There  is  no  ;  at  the  end  of  #include  becoz it  is  not  a  statement

7) #include  file ---->  file  may  contain  functions, macros, structures  and  so on
                          ---->   All  of  them  are  substituted  by  preprocessor  at  compile  time

8) # is preprocessor directive ----> Invitation   to     preprocessor

9) Preprocessor  job  is  expanding  the  file
     i.e.  File  contents  are  substituted

10) #include  <file> ----> File  is  searched  in  every  directory(or  folder)  except  current  working
                                     directory(cwd)

11) It  leads  to  error  when  file  is  in  cwd.

12) Therefore  <>   are used  when  file  is  not  in  the  cwd

13) Header  files are  not  in  cwd  and  hence  <>   are  used  for  header  files

14)  #include  "file" ---> File  is  searched   in  every  directory(folder)  starting  from  current  working
                                      directory(cwd)
				      i.e.  file  is  searched  in  cwd  first,  if  it  is  not  found  in  cwd,  file  is  searched
                                      in  other   standard    directories.

15) Quotes(")  are used  when  file  is  in  cwd.

16) n  directories  are  searched  when  ""  are  used  and
      n - 1  directories  are  searched  when  <>  are  used

17)  #include  "c: \ sri \ file"   ---->  File   is  searched  in  the  specified  path  i.e.  c: \ sri

18) File  is  searched  in  only  one  directory(sri)  when  path  is  specified  and    path  is  used  when           we  know  the  location  of  the  file

19)  #include  "d:\file"
        c:  -->  Hard  disk
	d:  -->  Usually  cd  drive      but  not  always
	e:  -->  Usually  pen  drive  but  not  always

20) File  can  be  searched  on  Hard  disk , cd ,  pen  drive , ......  by  specifying  the  drive  name

Comments
----------------
1)  //  is  used    for  single  line  comment

2)  /*
                ...
	        ...
                ....
    */  is  used   for  multiline  comment

3) Comments  are  ignored  by  compiler  i.e. Comments  are  not  compiled (i.e. Translated)

4) There  are  no  comments  at  runtime(i.e  execution  time)

5)  Comments  are  used   whereever  clarifications  are  needed

6) Comments  improve  program  clarity  and  readability

7)  .c  file  may  contain  comments  but  not  .exe  file  becoz  comments  are  ignored

8) Comments  can  be  written  any  where  in  the  program(begining,end  or  middle  of  the  program)

9)  Nested  comments  are  not  allowed  i.e.  Don't  write  comment  in  a  comment
            /*
                                .....
		/*
		              ...
		*/
		....
          */

10) Nested  single  line  comments   are  allowed
