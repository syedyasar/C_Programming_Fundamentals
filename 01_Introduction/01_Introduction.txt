Introduction
--------------------
1)  'C'  language   is  designed  by  Dennis  Ritchie  in  the  year  1968  at  Bell  lab's,  USA.

2)  'C'  is  designed  in  view  of  Unix  opearting  system

3)  'C'  is  called  System  Software  Language.

4)  'C'  is  best  suited  for  system  software  applications  like  design  of  compiler, assembler,  linker,
      loader,   driver, Operating  System  and   so  on

5)  'C'  is  not  used  for  business  applications, data  base  applications,web  applications and so on.
     In other words,  'C'  is  used  for  system  software  applications

6)  'C'  is  called  middle  level  language
      i.e.  'C'  is  used  to  design  application  programs(factorial  of  a  number,gcd  of  2  numbers ,  sorting of
      numbers, ......)  and  system  programs  (desgining  compiler , driver , O.S,....)


1) Every  'C'  program  must  contain  main  function.
    In  otherwords,  'c' program  can  not be executed without main function

2) '\n'    means  end  of  a  line  i.e.  Go  to  next  line

3) printf  means  write value to  console(monitor)


4) printf    is    a    pre-defined  function  in    <stdio.h>    file  (Standard input output header  file)

5)  //  means  comment   and  comments  are  not   executed
     i.e. comments  are  ignored  by  the  computer

6) ;  is  called  statement  terminator
    i.e.  end  of  a  statement

7)  //  is  single  line  comment

8)  /*
     ....
     ....
     ....
     */   is  multiline  comment


String
----------
1) It  is  a  collection  of  characters  terminated  by  '\0'  where    '\0'  is  null  character

2) '\0'  means  end  of  the  string.

3) String  may  contain  alphabets, digits  and  special  characters  .
    Therefore  String  is  also  known  as    alphanumeric.

4) String  must  be  enclosed  in  double  quotes

5) It  is  system  which  appends  '\0'  at  the  end  of  the  string  (but  not  programmer)

6) "Hyd"  contains  4  characters  and  4th  character  is  '\0'.

7) String  is  processed  until  '\0'

8) Characters  beyond  '\0'  are  not  processed
     i.e.  processing  stops  when  '\0'  is  reached.

9) Empty  string ( "" )   contains  single  character  i.e.  '\0'
    Eg:
    a)  "Rama  Rao"
    b)  "9247"
    c)  "+-$"
    d)  "A2#"
    e)  ""  (Empty  string)
