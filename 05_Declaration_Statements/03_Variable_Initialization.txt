Declaration  statements
-----------------------------------------
1) Creating  a  variable  and  allocation  of  memory  to  the  variable  is  known  as  declaration.

2)  int  i  ;    ------>  Variable  'i'  is  created  and  4B  of  memory  is  allocated  to  variable  'i'
     float  f;   ------>  Variable  'f'  is  created  and  4B  of  memory  is  allocated  to  variable  'f'
     char  c;   ----->  Variable  'c'  is  created  and  1B  of  memory  is  allocated  to  variable  'c'
     The  above  3  statements   are  declaration  statements.

3) Variables  can  not  be  used  without  declaration
     i.e.  Declare  variables  first  and  then  use  them

4) Variables  can    be  declared  any  where  in  the  program  but  not  necessarily  at  the  begining (in  gcc
    Compiler)

5)  Variable  must  be  declared  before  its  first  use

6) If  a  program  contains  10  variables,  each  of  the  10  variables  must  be  declared  before  their  usage.

Note:
Variables  must  be  declared  at  the  begining  in  turbo  'c'  compiler  but  not  in  gcc  compiler
