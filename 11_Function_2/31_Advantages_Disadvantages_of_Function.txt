Advantages  of  function
---------------------------------------
1)  Repetitive  coding  can  be  avoided
     ----------------------------------------------------------
    When  same  code(i.e. statements)  is  repeated  at  different  places  of  the  program,  function   is   used  as  an
    alternative
    i.e.  Write  the  code  only  once  in  the  function  and  call  the  function  wherever    the   code  is  required.
    Thus    repetative  coding  can  be    avoided  by  using  function.

     Eg1 :   void  f1()
	        {
			printf("Hyd\n");
			printf("Sec\n");
			printf("Cyb\n");
		}
		main()
                {
	            f1();
                    ....
	            .....
	            f1();
                }

     Eg2 :  When  100  statements  are  repeated  at  2  different  palces  of  the  program,  write  those  100
               statements  in  a  function  and  call  function  whereever  those  100  statements  are  required.
               Thus  100 + 100 = 200    statements  are  reduced  to  100  + 1 + 1 = 102  statements.
               Size  of  the  program  is  also  reduced

     Eg3 :  Find  4! , 9!  and  7!.    Don't  write  same  code  3  times  instead  design  a  function  for  n!  and  call  the
               function  3  times
               int  fact(int  n)
               {
		    ......
               }
               fact(4);
	       fact(9);
	       fact(7);

2)  Reusability
     ------------------
a) Function  defined  in    a  program    can  be  called  from  a  different  program.  This  is  called  reusing  the
    function  and  it  is  possible  by  #include  "file"

b) Don't  define  same  function  in  every  program  becoz  it  is  a  waste  of  time  and  money.
    i.e. Define  function  only  once  and  call  the  function  from  any  other  program  by  simply  including   the
    corresponding  file.

c) Reuse  the  function  but  not  rewrite

Note:
i) Save  main  function  in  a  differnet  file  but  not  along  with  other  functions
    i.e  If    a  program  contains  10  functions,  save  9  functions  in  file1.c  and  main    function  in  file2.c

ii) Advantage  of  saving  main  function  in  a    differnet  file  is  that  the  9  functions  of  file1.c  can  be  used  by
    any  another  program  by  simply  including  file1.c .   We  need  not  comment  anything    in  file1.c   becoz
    main  is  in  a  different  file.

iii) Thus  commenting  burden  is  avoided

3)  Modularity
     -------------------
a)  Don't  write  whole  program  logic  in  a  single  function  main.

b)  Write  a  separate  function  for  each  task.
      Eg:  Read  inputs  in  a  function,  do  computations  in  another  function  and  display  results  in  3rd   function.
             Call  all  the  functions  from  main.

c)  'C'  is  called  Structured  programming  language    becoz   'C'  program  is  divided  into  functions  and  each
      function   does  a  different  task.

*d)  Divide  a  large  program  into  modules  and  implement  each  module  by  a  function

Eg:   void  read()
	{
		reads  inputs  may  be  p ,  t  ,  r
	}
	void compute()
	{
		do  computations  may  be  si  and  ci
	}
	void  disp()
	{
		prints   results  i.e  si  and  ci
	}
	main()
	{
		read();
                compute();
		disp();
	}

Disadvantage:
----------------------
Processor  time  is  wasted
-------------------------------------------
1) Sequential  execution  of  statements  is  fast  but  function  execution  is  slow  due  to  branching.

2) Processor  time  is  wasted  (approx  :  1  micro  sec)    due  to  branching.

3) As  number  of  function  calls  increase,  program  execution  becomes  slow.

*4) Therefore  minimize  number   of  function  calls  and  don't  call  same  function  too  many  times.

Eg1 :    Find  4!    three  times.
            int      ans = fact(4);
            Call  the  function  only  once  and  assign  the  result  to  a  vaiable.
            Use  variable  ans  subsequently  and  don't  call  the  function  again

Eg2 :    a * a * a  is  fast  in  execution  compared  to  pow(a , 3).
            Expression  evaluation  is  fast  and  function  execution  is  slow.
            When  there  is  an  alternative  to  function,  prefer  it.
