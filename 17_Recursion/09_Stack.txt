Stack
------------
1) It  is  a  group  of  memory    locations  where  operation  is  LIFO  (Last  in  First  out)

2) Last  inserted  element  in  the  stack  is  first  removed
    Eg:  10 , 20 , 30  and  40  are inserted  into  the  stack  and  they  are  deleted  in  reverse order   40 , 30 , 20 , 10

3) Address  of  next  stmt(called  return  address)  is  represented  in  the  stack  when  there  is   a   function  call

4) After  called  function  terminates,  return  address  is  removed  from  the  stack  and  execution  resumes    from
    statement  following  the  function  call

5) It  is  end  of  the  program  when  stack  is  empty

6) It  is  OS    which  uses  stack  during  program  execution

7) Stack  contains  return  addresses

8) main()
    {
	f1();
       1000 : next stmt;
    }   --->  End  of  the  program  becoz  stack  is   empty
    void  f1()
    {
  	  f2();
	  2000 :  next stmt;
     } --->  OS deletes 1000  from stack  and  execution resumes from  address  1000
     void  f2()
     {
     }  --->  OS deletes 2000  from stack  and  execution resumes from  address 2000
