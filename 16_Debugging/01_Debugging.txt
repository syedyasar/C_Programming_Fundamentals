Debugging
-----------------
1) Bug  is  an  error

2) Debugging  is  locating  and  correcting  errors  of  the  program

3) Debugging  plays  an  important   phase  in  program  development

4) There  are  4  types  of  errors
     a)  Syntax  Error  or  Compile  time  error
     b)  Linker  Error
     c)  Runtime  Error
     d)  Logical  Error  or  Semantic  Error

Syntax  Error  or  Compile  Time  Error
---------------------------------------------------------------
1) It  is  due  to  grammetical  mistake

2) It  is  reported  when  syntax  of  the  statement  is  violated

3) It  is  reported  at  compile  time
    i.e.  Syntax  errors  are  reported   when   program   is  compiled

4) It  is  compiler  which  is  testing   for  syntax  errors

5) If  there  is  atleast  one  syntax  error,  program  is  not  translated  to  machine  code
    i.e. Program  must  be  error  free  inorder  to  perform  translation

6) All  syntax  errors  are  reported  simultaneously

Eg:
1) a = 25    ---->  ;  is  missing

2)  if  a > b    ---->  Condition  with  out  ()

3)  (a * (b + c)    ---->  ')'  is  missing

4)  x = 25;  ---->   Variable  is  not  declared  i.e. Variable   is  used  without  declaration


Linker  Error
--------------------
1) It  is   reported  when  we  try  to  call  non-existing  function
     Eg  1  :    f1();  ---->    but  function  f1  does  not  exist  in  the  program  and  hence it  leads  to  Linker  error

     Eg  2  :   scant("%d"  , &a);    --->  Linker  error  becoz   scant  function  does  not  exist

2) It  is  reported  at  Linking  time
    i.e.  Linker  errors  are  reported  when  program is  linked

3) It  is  linker  which  is  testing   for  linker  errors

4) If  there  is  atleast  one  linker  error,  .exe  file  is  not  generated
    i.e. Program  must  be  error  free  inorder  get  exe  file

5) All  linker  errors  are  reported  simultaneously

Runtime  Error
-------------------------
1) It  is  due  to  no  result   for    an  expression  or  statement
    Eg  1  :    7/0  ---->  division  by  zero  leads  to  runtime  error
    Eg  2  :    array[Invalid  subscript]  -->    Array  subscript  out  of  boundaries
    Eg  3  :  sqrt(-25)  --->  Runtime  Error
    Eg  4  :  Printer  without  paper
    Eg  5  :  cd  drive  without  cd
    Eg  6  :  Illegal  memory  access

2) It  is  reported  at  run  time or execution  time
    i.e.  Runtime    errors  are  reported  when  program is  executed

3) It  is  OS  which  is  testing  for  runtime  errors

4) If  there  is  atleast  one  runtime  error,  results  are  not  obtained
    i.e.  Program  must  be  error  free  inorder  to  get  results

5) Runtime  errors  are  reported  one  at  a  time

6) This  is  because  rest  of  the  program  is  skipped  when  there  is  a  runtime  error

7) Syntax, Linker  and  Runtime  errors  are  easy  to  debug  becoz   system  reports  both  line  number
    and  error



Logical  error
---------------------
1) It  is  due  to  a  mistake  in  the  logic  of  the  program

2) It  is  not  an  error  but  it  leads  to  incorrect  results

3) It  is  most  difficult  to  debug  becoz  no  error  is  reported
